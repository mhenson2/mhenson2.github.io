I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. Currently, I am working on a project to maximize happiness in marriage using optimal control and differential game theory. I am passionate about using mathematics to solve real world problems. While not my primary research area, I am prepared to tackle most problems in mathematical modeling, as well as machine learning, ODEs/PDEs, boundary value problems, time dependent problems, and optimization. I also love learning, so any area I do not know, I am willing to learn.

I have a masters degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington, and I earned my bachelors of science in Mathematics from Spelman College. 

## Here are some of my recent projects!
